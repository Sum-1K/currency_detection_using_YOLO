# currency_detection_using_YOLO
A simple currency note classifier using YOLOv8, which captures image from camera and converts the result to speech

To create a similar model first you must have a dataset in YOLO classifier format

Run train.py on it to train it on the classified data

Add path to the trained model in currency_detection.py to use the classifier
